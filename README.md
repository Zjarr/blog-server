Server for personal blog

## Setup
To get the project running locally:
- Add a .env file with the required environment variables on the root folder. These variables must me provided to you.

- [Download and setup MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) It is recommended to use the `brew` method.

- Create an authentication user
	```
	use admin
	```

	```
	db.createUser(
		{
			user: "admin",
			pwd: "admin12345",
			roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
		}
	)
	```

- Run MongoDB and add a DB with the name `blog`.
	```
	use blog
	```

- Add a `users` collection
	```
	db.createCollection('user')
	```

- [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended)

- Install dependencies and run the project:
	```
	nvm use && npm install
	```

## Run
- When all the dependencies are set simply run:
	```
	npm run start:dev
	```
- The project uses an linter to check for common mistakes while coding (unused imports and variables, missing `;`, extra whitespaces, etc.). It will show the location and the warning on the console. Please fix them before pushing your work.

## Naming convention & file structure
- Files:
	- `*unique-name*.subfolder.subfolder.folder.ts` where the `subfolder` and `folder` names must be the singular names of the file's parent folders. For example:
        ```
        .
        └── src
           ├── blog
           │  └── model
           │     └── base.model.blog.ts
           │     └── query
           │        ├── blog.query.blog.ts
           │        └── blogs.model.blog.ts
           └── category
           .  └── model
           .     └── base.model.categoty.ts
        ```

- Folders:
	- These don't have specific names, use as required but they must be meaningful. For example, if you need an `lib` folder to store common values, use: 
        ```
        .
        └── src
           ├── lib
           .  └── values
           .     ├── days.values.lib.ts
           .     └── months.values.lib.ts
        ```

	- `[Intention]/[card-number]/[short-description]`, for example:
		- Feat/1234356/new-images-handler
